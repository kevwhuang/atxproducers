    "bio": "Known by the alias Henyx, Houston's very own Braulio “Lio” Guerra is widely recognized for his unequivocally innovative sound design skills. Having been a part of many projects throughout his career, Lio's most notable accomplishment was being a featured artist in Geometry Dash, the #2 paid mobile arcade game in the Google Play Store. A father by day and a mad synthesist by night, Lio hopes to push the boundaries of sound design and inspire others to go beyond their limits.",
