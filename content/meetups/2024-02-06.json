    "title": "Growl Theory, a Vital Sound Design Workshop",
    "speaker": "Henyx",
    "description": "Sound design... These two words are often associated with a searing headache and a sudden loss of motivation, but why is that? With this workshop, I aim to demystify the otherwise uncharted field of sound design, and teach producers of all skill levels to make their very own growl bass with ease. There's no better feeling in the world than making a sound and thinking “OMG, I'm literally Skrillex,” so ideally this presentation should be a lot of that for everyone.",
