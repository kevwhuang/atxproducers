    "speaker": "Kai Castro",
    "title": "DJing Fundamentals for Producers",
    "description": "DJing and producing go hand in hand, but they're vastly different skills that both require time to improve at. In tonight's workshop, Kai Castro will cover the first steps in getting started on your own DJ journey, including: what gear is involved; how to approach a gig; how to transition between tracks; how to produce DJ-friendly music. There will be discussions as well as live instructor demos on industry-standard Pioneer DJ equipment. Attendees are encouraged to test their skills by participating in live transitions during the workshop. If you'd like to mix your own music, please bring your audio on a flash drive (bonus points if it's formatted for rekordbox).",
