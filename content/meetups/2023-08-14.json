    "description": "Making music on commission is challenging, because your client probably isn't a musician. It can be hard to know where to even start. Hopefully, this presentation can help break down the process of delivering a great track to someone whose needs seem hard to meet, and help you learn, as a producer, how to take control of any situation in the studio.",
