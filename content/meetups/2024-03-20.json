    "description": "In tonight's workshop I'll demonstrate how I write memorable, functional, and interesting electronic music from scratch, with tips on workflow, melodies, form, and harmonies. By using templates, reference tracks, theme variations, and creative sampling to inspire creativity, you can easily turn an inkling of an idea into a full track. With strong themes and a direction, you'll be able to work through creative blocks and produce something worth listening to!",
